# Driftya

A quiet place for short notes,  
like a message in a bottle.

Some thoughts don’t want an audience.
They just want somewhere to go.

Driftya is an experiment in sharing notes without feeds,
likes, or performance.
You write a short note, it travels to one person,
and they can let it drift again.

There’s no scrolling.
No public metrics.
Just one note at a time.
