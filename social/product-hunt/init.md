A note finds you, you pass it on, and the story grows.

What would make you reply?

Instagram, Tiktok and Mastadon, inspired me to build this, I thought a reply should feel more meaningful.

I think "likes" does not really add meaningful value to the actually content more than giving the creator more pressure to create more content. I believe likes should come as a reply instead with constructive criticism.

I hope Driftya will feel more rewarding for the replier to engage in someone elses content because the note is passed person to person, the content creator should be rewarded by feeling this content has been completed instead, just like clearing a backlog.
